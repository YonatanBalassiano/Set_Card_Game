BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

1. By using all Final values for conctant values and use every field of config 
2. Dealer.removeAllCardsFromTable,Dealer.ClockReset, Dealer.isSet, player.createArtificialIntelligence, player.keyPressed, player.point, player.penalty, player.run
2. table - all
3. DealerTest.resetClock
--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

1. When dealer thread is terminated, call terminate() function for all players and use Join() function to wait untill they end.
2. Dealer.Terminate()
3. check the Terminal for Terminted prints
--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

1. Use ENUM for determain in which state we are in, and according to the state we updated the clock. 
2. Dealer.timerLoop , Dealer.updateTimerDisplay, Dealer.ClockReset
3. Run the game for every state and checked the correctness of the clock UI 
--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

1. Use AtomicBoolean Locks and wait with limitation. Open no more Threads then required
2. Dealer.sleepUntilWokenOrTimeout , plater.run, player.createArtificialIntelligence 
3. Checked the log file for [SEVERE ] setting player 5 freeze to X .. and check the final freeze time to match the configuration
